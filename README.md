# Isaac-Kim-Project02

Please look at the three jupyter notebook files. <br>
I scraped the data from exoplanet.eu in Project_2_Scrape_Data.ipynb. <br>
Then I performed the majority of the EDA/Analysis/Regression in Project_2_Regression.ipynb. <br>
Finally, I used my model on extra data as well as used my model for categorical analysis on my original data in Goldilocks.ipynb
